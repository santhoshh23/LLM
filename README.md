# LLM
A scalable llm

Part 1 — Core Transformer Architecture
1.1 Positional embeddings (absolute learned vs. sinusoidal)
1.2 Self-attention from first principles (manual computation with a tiny example)
1.3 Building a single attention head in PyTorch
1.4 Multi-head attention (splitting, concatenation, projections)
1.5 Feed-forward networks (MLP layers) — GELU, dimensionality expansion
1.5 Residual connections & LayerNorm
1.6 Stacking into a full Transformer block
Part 2 — Training a Tiny LLM
2.1 Byte-level tokenization
2.2 Dataset batching & shifting for next-token prediction
2.3 Cross-entropy loss & label shifting
2.4 Training loop from scratch (no Trainer API)
2.5 Sampling: temperature, top-k, top-p
2.6 Evaluating loss on val set
Part 3 — Modernizing the Architecture
3.1 RMSNorm (replace LayerNorm, compare gradients & convergence)
3.2 RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings) — theory & code
3.3 SwiGLU activations in MLP
3.4 KV cache for faster inference
3.5 Sliding-window attention & attention sink
3.6 Rolling buffer KV cache for streaming
Part 4 — Scaling Up
4.1 Switching from byte-level to BPE tokenization
4.2 Gradient accumulation & mixed precision
4.3 Learning rate schedules & warmup
4.4 Checkpointing & resuming
4.5 Logging & visualization (TensorBoard / wandb)
Part 5 — Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
5.1 MoE theory: expert routing, gating networks, and load balancing
5.2 Implementing MoE layers in PyTorch
5.3 Combining MoE with dense layers for hybrid architectures
